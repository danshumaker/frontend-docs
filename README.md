# Intro

At Phase2 we take a two-tiered approach to frontend:

1. [Document](frontend/thinking.md) the mental models, processes, tools, and conventions of frontend development
2. Anything that can be captured and automated from the documentation is included within our tooling, called [Particle](particle/intro.md).

For example, it's one thing to declare,

> Explicitly terminate all JavaScript statements with a semicolon.

It's even better to configure eslint to extend the AirBnB ES6 standard, give realtime feedback during development, and prevent commits and fail builds that don't adhere to this rule.
