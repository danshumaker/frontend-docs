# Why doesn't Particle support _?
Particle is designed to be application-agnostic. If your application can use javascript and/or css, a Particle-built design system can be compiled for it.

If you want Particle to include a specific app by default, pull requests welcome and encouraged! 

# I don't need _ app, how do I remove it?
A couple files need to be adjusted. See [here](/apps/general/#adding-or-removing-apps) for the breakdown.

# What's with the goat?
It's cute right?
