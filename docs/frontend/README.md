# Intro

Frontend development involves the architecture and development of anything visible within a browser. To quote the exhaustive [Front-end Developer Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#2),

> A front-end developer architects and develops websites and web applications using web technologies \(i.e., [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)\), which typically runs on the [Open Web Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform) or acts as compilation input for non-web platform environments \(i.e., [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)\).
