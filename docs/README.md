## Frontend Docs

At [Phase2](https://www.phase2technology.com) we take a two-tiered approach to frontend:

1. [Document](frontend/thinking.md) the mental models, processes, tools, and conventions of frontend development
1. Anything that can be captured and automated from the documentation is included within our tooling, called [Particle](particle/README.md).
