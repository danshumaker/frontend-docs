## What is Particle?

Particle is an opinionated set of tools and examples to:

1. Build one or more application-agnostic **design systems** made of assets like Twig, Sass, JavaScript, images, etc
2. Apply those **design systems** to a locally-served Pattern Lab for rapid prototyping
3. Apply those **design systems** to other consuming apps like, Drupal

## Particle Features

* Drupal theme, [Pattern Lab](https://patternlab.io/docs/) instance
* Strict [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) component structure
* Robust Webpack bundling of all CSS, JavaScript, font, and static assets for multiple targets
* [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for local hosting and hot reloading of assets into Pattern Lab
* Iconfont auto-generation
* Bootstrap 4 integration, used for all starting example components
* Auto-linting against the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and sane Sass standards
* All Webpack configuration is fully configurable
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/README.md) transformation powered by [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).
