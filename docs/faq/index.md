# why doesn't Particle support ___?
Particle is designed to be application-agnostic. If your application can use javascript and/or css, a Particle-built design system can be compiled for it.

If you want particle to include a specific app by default, pull requests welcome!

# what's with the goat?
it's cute right?

# troubleshooting
it's usually `npm rebuild node-sass` or a misplaced comma during a twig compile.

sometimes it's linting rules, which can be disabled as needed. we recommend not doing that too often, though.

will fill this out more as more errors/pain points are found :(
